title: Phone Validation on Google Sheets
---
Phone Validation Add-on prevents bounced phone calls because these main features:

* It provides a real-time validation lookup directly on Google Sheets. You receive fresh data upon request and don’t need to export/import contacts for the verification process.
* If the phone number is valid, you will get the city information.
* It shows you not valid phone numbers.

#### Common questions

**How do you validate the data?**

We have built a service to carry out validation at different levels: a phone number format, a country and city information, a carrier information. The add-on is connected to the service via API.

**How can I be sure that you will not steal my data?**

For security reasons and in order to protect your data, we do not collect (or share data) from your validation lookups on our servers. We don’t even have a database to store data.
